- Allow checking for similar files by some criteria (approximate size,
  file magic type, file extension, etc)

- Limit the window for duplicate extent calculation to limit overall time
  spent looking for duplicates

- Store results of our search to speed up subsequent runs.
  - In particular, store file system transaction ids so we can use the
    equivalent of btrfs's find-new

- Wrap bytes <-> blocks conversions

- Do checksumming in seperate threads

- Add an optional mode to do duplicate checking with resolution of extent
  owners (expensive).

- Allow duperemove to take as input it's previous output so a user
  could run in readonly mode, record dupes and then pass them later to
  duperemove for potential deduplication.

- Allow for flexible selection of dedupe target
