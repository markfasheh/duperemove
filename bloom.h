 * Initialize the bloom filter for use.

 * The filter is initialized with a bit field and number of hash functions

 *
 * Optimal number of bits is:
 *     bits = (entries * ln(error)) / ln(2)^2
 *
 * Optimal number of hash functions is:
 *     hashes = bpe * ln(2)
 *
 * Parameters:
 * -----------
 *     bloom   - Pointer to an allocated struct bloom (see above).
 *     entries - The expected number of entries which will be inserted.
 *     error   - Probability of collision (as long as entries are not
 *               exceeded).
 *
 * Return:
 * -------
 *     0 - on success
 *     1 - on failure
