.SH "NAME"
duperemove \- Find duplicate extents and print them to stdout
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBduperemove\fR \fI[options]\fR \fIfiles...\fI
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBduperemove\fR is a simple tool for finding duplicated extents and
submitting them for deduplication. When given a list of files it will
hash their contents on a block by block basis and compare those hashes
to each other, finding and categorizing extents that match each
other. When given the \fB-d\fR option, \fBduperemove\fR will submit those
extents for deduplication using the btrfs-extent-same ioctl.

.SH "GENERAL"
Duperemove has two major modes of operation one of which is a subset
of the other.

.SS "Readonly / Non-deduplicating Mode"

When run without \fB-d\fR (the default) duperemove will print out one or
more tables of matching extents it has determined would be ideal
candidates for deduplication. As a result, readonly mode is useful for
seeing what duperemove might do when run with \fB-d\fR. The output could
also be used by some other software to submit the extents for
deduplication at a later time.

It is important to note that this mode will not print out \fBall\fR
instances of matching extents, just those it would consider for
deduplication.

Generally, duperemove does not concern itself with the underlying
representation of the extents it processes. Some of them could be
compressed or undergoing I/O. In dedupe mode, the kernel handles
those details and therefore we try not to replicate that work.

.SS "Deduping Mode"

This functions similarly to readonly mode with the exception that the
duplicated extents found in our "read, hash, and compare" step will
actually be submitted for deduplication. An estimate of the total data
deduplicated will be printed after the operation is complete. This
estimate is calculated by comparing the total amount of shared bytes
in each file before and after the dedupe.

.SH "OPTIONS"
\fIfiles\fR can refer to a list of regular files and directories. If a
directory is specified, all regular files within it will be also
scanned.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Enable recursive dir traversal.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
De-dupe the results - only works on \fIbtrfs\fR.
.TP

\fB\-A\fR
Opens files readonly when deduping. Primarily for us by privileged
users on readonly snapshots.

.TP
\fB\-b size\fR
Use the specified block size. The default is \fB128K\fR.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Print numbers in human-readable format.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Be verbose.

.TP
\fB\-?, --help\fR
Prints help text.

.SH "FAQ"

.B "Is there an upper limit to the amount of data duperemove can process?"

Right now duperemove has been tested on small numbers of VMS or iso
files (5-10). I don't believe there should be a major problem scaling
that up to 50 or so.

.B "Why does it not print out all duplicate extents?"

Internally duperemove is classifying extents based on various criteria
like length, number of identical extents, etc. The printout we give is
based on the results of that classification.

.B "How can I find out my space savings after a dedupe?"

\fBDuperemove\fR will print out an estimate of the saved space after a
dedupe operation. You can also do a \fBdf\fR before the dedupe
operation, then a \fBdf\fR about 60 seconds after the operation. It is
common for \fIbtrfs\fR space reporting to be 'behind' while delayed
updates get processed, so an immediate df after deduping might not
show any savings.

.B "Why is the total deduped data report an estimate?"

The kernel may not be able to deduplicate data for some reason.

.SH "NOTES"
Deduplication is currently only supported by the \fIbtrfs\fR filesystem.
